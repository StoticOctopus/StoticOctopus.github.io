<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>
I’m Jordan Estrada — a problem-solver, a builder, and someone who believes good technology should feel effortless.
I study Information Systems with a cybersecurity emphasis at Utah State University, where I explore the relationship
between people and the systems they rely on every day.
</p>

<p>
My work blends technical curiosity with creativity. From cloud-based APIs to websites like this one, I enjoy
taking ideas from concept to reality and understanding how the decisions behind the scenes shape the experiences
users have in front of the screen.
</p>

<p>
In the long run, I want to build tools, platforms, and digital experiences that make people say:
<span style="font-style: italic;">“I didn’t know tech could be this smooth.”</span>
