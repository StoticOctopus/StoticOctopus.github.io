The purpose of my website is to showcase my projects, skills, and achievements as an Information Systems student. It will serve as a portfolio to share with future employers and recruiters.
The scope includes three main pages: a homepage, a portfolio section, and a contact form. The site will focus on professional presentation and be updated as I complete new projects.
